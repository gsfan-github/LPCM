LPCM: a Cross-platform Linux PC Cluster Monitoring System Based on C/S Architecture

Linux PC cluster monitor(LPCM), an economical and portable cross-platform cluster monitoring system is developed and presented. The motivation of this work is that 1) comparable commercial cluster management software is usually very expensive; 2) the functionalities of many existing open source cluster monitoring software are limited and they are not flexible enough to fit our needs. LPCM is designed and implemented based on the integration of Linux proc file system, socket network communication, and Java Swing interface visualization technologies. The design of LPCM follows the Client/Server model and it has some valuable characteristics such as less system resource usage, higher reliability, friendly interface, etc. LPCM is distributed as an open source project and it shall be useful for some small to medium-sized cluster and cloud platform monitoring.
